Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python:

print("Hello, World!")
You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout:

my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)
"""

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print "Hello, World!"
    
    
"""
Expected Output
Hello, World!
